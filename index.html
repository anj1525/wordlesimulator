        Welcome to Wordle! The rules are simple: input words to try and figure out what the 'right' word is. <br> If the letter is not in the word, the square will appear with a greyish-pink color. If it is in the word <br> but in the wrong spot, it will appear in a coral color. Finally, if the letter is in the word and in the <br> right spot, it will appear in the darker pink color. <br> Good luck!
